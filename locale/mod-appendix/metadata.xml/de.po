"Ein Ausrüstungs-Erweiterungspaket, welches zusammen mit Multiverse verwendet "
"werden soll. Beinhaltet viele unterschiedliche Waffen- und Drohnenkonzepte, "
"die aus verschiedenen Gründen unpassend für den Basismod waren.\n"
"Während es versucht wird ausgewogen zu bleiben, ist die Mod nicht ohne "
"Grunde kein Teil von Multiverse, aufzuweisen sind höhere Variationen in "
"Balance. Es gibt Waffen, die sich zu sehr an bereits existierenden "
"Waffenkonzepten orientieren, Nischenwaffen, schwer zu balancierende Gimmicks "

"Gegner nutzen nun auch manchen der neuen Waffen, blaue Optionen wurden "
"aktualisiert um relevante Ausrüstung zu beinhalten und Shops + Sylvan werden "
"diese nun auch manchmal verkaufen. Manche Gegenstände haben unterschiedliche "
"Seltenheit in spezifischen Sektoren.\n"
