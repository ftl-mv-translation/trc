	<text>Rather curiously, it appears the signal being broadcast here is somehow only visible to you. It vanishes a few moments after you arrive, and shortly after the very space around you seems to contract a bit then freeze. A strange ship simply appears beside you, neither uncloaking nor jumping in.
	
	The ship hails you, and on the other end is a strangely dressed Slug. He almost resembles the traveling merchant... but... that doesn't make any sense? "Sssstranger! G-greeeeeetingsss! I know you mussst be very, very confusssed, and I'd sssurely love to anssswer all your quessstions! But I've got ssso, ssso little time..."</text>

			The Slug is clearly uncomfortable. He paces a bit, flicking his eyestalk back and forth. "Now, l-look here sssstranger. I ain't... I ain't really ssss'possse to be tellin' you thisss. Trade sssecret and all that. I usssed to work for sssome powerful people, and they don't really want you'sss typesss findin' out about them. Now I would sssay callin' me ssssome ssssort of... interdimenssssional fugitive on the run from god issss a bit of an exaggeration but... well it ain't far from the truth either."
			
			The Slug forces a chuckle. "Now if you haven't noticed, around not too long ago a buncha new equipment'sss been sssshowing up outta nowhere. That... may have been my doing. I ssssorta... made a deal with the devil, ssso to sssspeak. 'Cept thissss devil's the trick playin' kind. I jussst wanted my handssss on ssssome... foreign tech, but now I've created a ssssort of interdimenssssional leak. Heheh. Heh. Yeah it'ssss not that funny. Actually, we're all kinda sssscrewed.

Ssssso... uh... that'sss where you come in! Hopefully! I can't really move around a lot, or elsssse my former employersss will track me.

Not jusssst for me, but you asss well. They're gonna dessscend on thissss place like a ssswarm of pirranhassss and it ain't gonna be pretty. And if they ssspot ME here, well, ssssame thing."
							
							The Slug leans in closer to the camera. "Look, I can make it worth you'ssss while, kay? It ain't the gunssss they're after. Sssure they'll ssscrub that clean eventually, but you'll be done with them by the time they do. Do me a favor here, and I'll let you keep a copy of whatever you bring back."
							
							The Slug pulls out a checklist and a red pen. With a flick of his tentacle, the checklist vanishes and reappears beside you. "Here'sss the lissst. Don't get too cocky. It'sss difficult keeping thessse guysss in one place without them being noticed, ssso we'ssss jusssst gonna sssstart with whichever'sss next on the lissst. I'm ssstill working on a permanent ssssolution to get them all back home, but until now they're trapped in a ssssort of death loop. Sssso you jussst gotta kill them, guilt free and all that, and that'll buy me ssssome more time."</text>

	<text>You're a bit taken aback to see a Federation Bomber nearby. You frantically double check your coordinates to make sure you're in the right place, while the ship approaches. Something strikes you as peculiar - its coloring is the inverse of standard Federation livery.</text>

	<choice hidden="true">
		<text>Hail the vessel.</text>
		<event>
			<text>You catch chatter on the anomalous ship's comms. It's unusually formal compared to the messy jargon of the Federation you're used to. Their captain returns the hail, saluting. "Greetings, U.F.C, this is the U.F.S.V. Bobcat. We are unable to determine our location, and have lost all communications with the F.G.C.S., nor have we been able to establish contact with any fellow U.F.O.'s before yourselves. We appear to be trapped in some sort of... T.D.C.S, and we would like to request assistance."</text>
			<choice hidden="true">
				<text>What do any of those acronyms mean?</text>
				<event>
					<text>The captain coughs. "Say again? Is this some kind of joke?" You shake your head. "Mhm. With due respect this is a significant infraction and bounds for a court martial... sir. I recommend you to consult your O.U.F.H.F.A.P.A.U. to refresh yourself on operation protocol before attempting to communicate and assist us. Until you straighten yourself out, you are compromising us and we will refuse to communicate with someone who has forgotten basic protocol, over."</text>
					<choice hidden="true">
						<text>What protocol?</text>
						<event>
							<text>"U.F.P.F.T.S.O.A.C.A.P." - Noticing your blank stare, the captain sighs. "United Federation Protocol For The Safety of All Citizens and Personnel. It encompasses all customs, etiquette, and diplomatic courtesy that all enlisted Federation personnel are mandated and trained to memorize and follow. I assume you are Federation personnel, as you responded to our D.S.I.C.O.E (Distress Signal in Case of Emergency) that was broadcasting on official United Federation channels.

But how then did you defeat the Rebellion? The clone army was instrumental in our campaigns against the formation of the Final Dominion of United Space during Operation F.A.L.T.T.R. and the overthrowal of Supreme Empress Nights."

									The captain crumples to the ground. "This is just... highly unpleasant. On the eve of my ascension to the Third Admiralty to be sucked away and cast into this alternate hellscape where the Rebellion remains alive, coffee isn't subsidized, and the ships don't even come with space suits! I can only reach the conclusion that if your Federation is this disorganized that it must be doomed to fail. Get out of my way, barbarian.

It is a tall order, but by my estimations we're around 54.3% of the way there! Perhaps someday your small, weak, flabby civilization will crawl its way out of the gutter and achieve greatness too!

For the noble god Thavl Eos, I rip off me arm and with it I craft the Heavenly Scepter! And for the almighty lord Gajgri, I chop off me leg and with it I made the Battle McStick. Me finest creation.

"It has been a long time since the devil arrived. It is the word the heavens are guarded by a new master. A lowly form, nay a mortal like me, who banished the devil with his arrival.
